Monster Hunter: World checks a lot of boxes.  It has great map design, an exceptional original soundtrack, is visually impressive and hits upon a fun gameplay loop.  That alone is enough to be noteworthy for a new release.  Unfortunately it has both design flaws and a lack of polish that hurt the game that is, and make me wish instead for the game that could be.

## Monster Hunting

The primary gameplay of Monster Hunter is of course hunting monsters.  Tracking and hunting monsters down to carve materials for your next upgrade.

### Tracking

The tracking mechanics are sadly lackluster.  The game opts for a very RPG approach.  You wander around until you start finding tracks.  A bar is filled up as you examine them, and the location of the monster is eventually revealed after reaching certain thresholds.

It's much too "gamey" for me.  I was really hoping for a system that rewarded the player for being observant.  Environmental cues like footprints could determine when a monster was last here and what direction they moved in.  You might see animals running away, indicating something much bigger is behind them.

I feel there was a missed opportunity for a satisfying hunting experience.  Reward player ingenuity and attentiveness, instead of simply filling up bars.

However there is at least one good counter point.  Most monsters have a home that they run to when injured, and a feeding ground they visit when hungry/exhausted.  Learning a monster's behavioural patterns means you're not always starting from scratch.  This is something attentive players may piece together.

### Combat

Combat actually feels pretty good.  Attacks feel weighty, and monsters feel alive.  There's a lot of weapon variety, and most offer a unique or interesting moveset.  Large weapons feel heavy, while small weapons feel quick and nimble.

At various health thresholds the monsters will begin to retreat, which requires you give chase and follow them to the next battleground.  While it can offer a nice breather as you prep for the next stage, this mechanic does start to get old after a while.

Monsters are generally well-telegraphed which allows you to learn their tells.  As a result of this, fights generally feel fair.  When you faint it's usually because you've over-extended and were taking too many risks.  There is however one major exception to this...

Stuns, and similar status effects will completely remove player control over your character.  A monster stomping nearby might trigger tremor which causes your character to wobble feebly for five or more seconds as they attempt to regain their balance.

I might call this artificial difficulty, but for fear of a semantic argument I think I'll just say it's game design that I don't agree with.

Watching your character stumble around while waiting to see if the monster takes that opportunity to swoop is never how I want to go down.  I am more than happy to be punished for over-extending, taking a needless risk, or just missing an essential timing.  I want to feel that it was an error I made, and not that an invisible status build up finally triggered at an inopportune time.

Eventually I designed a set of armour which prevented stuns, roars, tremors, and other tricks that remove the player's control.  Almost immediately I found the game was much more enjoyable to play this way.  I'm sure long-time fans of the series will disagree, but my only conclusion here is that these elements do not make the game more fun.

### Carving and Crafting

I really enjoy the carving and crafting system.  Rather than a traditional level up mechanic, it's a way of getting stronger that feels rewarding and immersive.  It also means that all players end up on an equal footing, where those who have invested more time are not necessarily any stronger.

Crafting armour also offers interesting bonuses which allow for a lot of creativity when designing a build.  Finding the best combinations of bonuses and defenses can be a fun challenge, and the loadouts system encourages using a variety of builds for different weapons, monsters, or even in online play.

While carving does have an element of randomness, it's does in a convincingly immersive way.  Certain parts can also be encouraged to drop by focusing on breaking certain parts of the monster (for instance, its horn).  This makes obtaining rarer materials less of a hassle.

## Difficulty

Most games offer a slowly-increasing difficulty curve, with the odd peak or trough to keep things interesting.  Monster Hunter: World, unfortunately, feels like a flat line.

Gear can be farmed from monsters, which offers a nice progression as you move onto more difficult challenges.  As your gear is upgraded at the same rate as the monsters though, it can seem like you're spinning your wheels.  The story is constantly telling you that this next monster is the "really big one", and it never really delivers on that promise.

Put bluntly, I found the game much too easy.  For a game to feel rewarding you must overcome adversity and I never felt like I was overcoming any serious challenge.  There was a short acclimation period when learning a new monster, and then it became just another creature to farm.  This feeling held throughout the game.  Even the run up to and final boss itself left me with no faints, only disappointment.

Past a certain point in the game I would have liked to see armour values decreased.  This would still encourage variety from the various armour skills, but would allow difficulty to scale up as the game progressed.  Limiting the player to only one mantle, or removing the more powerful mantles (rocksteady and temporal) would also help with this.

I understand one of the goals with MHW was to make the game more accessible to a wider audience.  They surely accomplished this, but may have sacrificed too much on difficulty in the process.  A slider to enable a hard mode would not be unappreciated.

Past the game's release, more difficult variants of monsters were also released.  Tempered monsters, and their direct upgrades arch-tempered monsters.  They too have more bark than bite.  It's possible that future "G-rank" monsters will step it up, but my guess is that new armour will quickly offset any difficulty increase.

## Meownster Design

One post-release monster did surprise me though, and that's Behemoth.  Behemoth is a large bull creature from the Final Fantasy series.  It's the first (and only) fight that I would describe as genuinely challenging.  It's also the fight that I had the most fun with, and may be the redeeming monster for me.

Both Behemoth and its upgraded form "Extreme Behemoth" require the player adapt their playstyle.  It's a punishing fight and very rewarding to complete.  My only real complaint is that it's a forced group fight.  The monster's health does not scale which means you have to rely on other players also playing perfectly.

Other monsters have their charm as well.  The Paolumu is a personal favorite.  It expands like a puffer fish, and when excited may start running and fall flat on its face.  This attention to detail really gives the game its character.

As you play through the story though, you'll find a number of monsters start feeling a bit samey.  The Uragaan feels a lot like the Radobaan.  The Lavasioth and Jyuratodus surely share a common ancestry.  And let's not even talk about the four variants of Rathalos/Rathian.

What's interesting to me is that there's many large monsters, and a handful of small monsters, but almost no medium monsters.  Filling in some more links in the food chain would make for a more convincing world.

## Complexity

MHW is a fairly complex game.  There's many overlaying systems, and I suspect most are vestiges of previous games in the series.  Complexity however should not be mistaken for depth.  Many systems could have been, and likely should have been simplified.

### Quests

Quests are divided into categories: assigned (story missions), optional, investigations, events, special assignments, arenas, challenges, and Kulve Taroth sieges.

Having so many categories can be confusing for new players.  It would be understandable if there were need for it, but many of these categories are ultimately redundant.

Optional quests contain mostly duplicate copies of other mission types.  The names are changed but the quests otherwise remain the same.  This means that completing all quests actually requires the player do so twice.  Allowing the player to instead replay missions would be more intuitive behaviour and remove the need for this category.

Special assignments are quests which were published during a post-release game update.  They could easily be integrated into the assigned quests menu (which notifies you of newly available quests), removing yet another category.

Challenge and arena quests are separated out into another menu system.  It's not clear to me why, but possibly to denote that they have leaderboard rankings.

Expeditions are a way to explore the world without taking on a quest.  When I started the game and wanted to explore, this was my preferred way to play.  There's a number of mechanics that reward exploration early.  Discovering camps unlocks shortcuts around the map.  Grimalkyne quests and field researchers offer more immersive "in-world quests" with useful rewards.  These were my favorite activities, and I was disappointed once they dried up.

### Food System

I played for 250 hours before I came to fully understand the food system.  I will attempt to sum it up briefly:

Food skills are determined by the color categories of foods that you select.  If enough of a color isn't selected (two foods per tier), then it falls back to randomly-cycling daily food skills.  Each skill has a chance of activating based on the number of fresh ingredients chosen, unless you use a food voucher in which case all skills are guaranteed to activate.  Fresh ingredients also determine max health and stamina, but items such as Ancient Potions can be used to maximize these instead.

Did you get all that?  I can't imagine a new player would.

This system works fine from a game balance perspective.  It allows players to optimize their preferred food skills and pay an item cost (vouchers or potions) to get a more aggressive buff.  The problem is simply how complicated it is.  I'm sure these mechanics could be organized in a way to satisfy player customization without requiring a video tutorial.

Gating the more powerful food skills behind random daily skills (eg. Felyne Insurance) also introduces an element of chance which I don't care for.  Instead, requiring the player choose to give up some max stamina for a specific food skill would have created a more interesting choice without having to wait on lady luck.

## Technical Issues

The game has been marred by a number of technical issues.  Some have been solved, while others remain unaddressed.

### PC Port

The PC version of the game started off rough, but has improved with updates.

In the original PC release of the game, aiming with a mouse moved a "virtual joystick".  This led to frustratingly slow and imprecise movements.  Raw mouse input was finally patched in after many months, but bizarrely has been hidden in the options menu.  Why this wasn't set as default, or even made the only input option is even more perplexing.

Even today the radial menu is simply nonfunctional for keyboard users.  The four cardinal directions can be selected, but items on an angle are unreachable.  It's possible this is an issue caused by key ghosting but I have not been able to find a solution.

Keyboard issues aside, the radial menu is a nice addition to Monster Hunter: World.  I'd actually prefer to use it exclusively, but unfortunately the classic bar menu cannot be disabled.

Network errors are hit and miss for players.  Some have been affected drastically while others have never seen one.  I fall into the former camp.  I've been booted from at least a dozen games with the error `50152-MW1`.  These seem to have been mostly resolved now, but during periods of peak server activity they can still crop up.

### Bugs and Polish

Even a year after release, there are still many bugs and rough edges that have not been addressed.  Many of these problems are low-hanging-fruit, and would be quite easy to fix.

* Item and equipment loadouts can be created, but not destroyed.
* Menu option names are completely undescriptive.
* The game consistently prioritizes picking up rocks over valuable monster loot, and always at the worst times.

These problems are readily apparent in playing the game.  My question is why they never came up during initial playtests.

### Streamlining

Similarly, many of the game's systems seem designed with the expectation that players will do one thing, when they instead always do another.

The timer at the end of the mission defaults to "Start expedition".  Never once have I intended to start an expedition after completing a quest, nor do the players I group up with online.  It vexes me that this is the default option.

If there is reason to start an expedition though, why not put us into expedition mode immediately and let us return to base whenever we want?  The timer offers little more than a forced time waster.

Most of the time you'll want to return to the hub after each quest to take care of any business which has changed: restock items, turn in quests to the resource center, harvest the ancient tree, update the ecological researcher, talk to the ship captain, and send out the palico safari.  Placing all of these maintenance tasks in close proximity would really cut down on the time spent before you're able to get out in the field again.

PC mods have shown just how much quality-of-life features can add to the game.  The mod [Improved NPC Locations](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/188) moves all NPCs into the Gathering Hub (or is it the Celestial Pursuit?).  This also encourages players to spend more time in the multiplayer area between missions.  The rest of Astora is singleplayer only, which really reduces the lively feel of the game.

Even the main menu could be streamlined.  You're asked to start a lobby every time you create a new game.  Listing your friends who are online requires navigating to a submenu, when that's information that should be known before deciding to start a new lobby or not.

## Conclusion

Monster Hunter: World has so much going for it, and that's what makes its flaws even more disappointing.  If I had a magic paintbrush I'd change one hundred little things about the game and I'm still not sure if I'd be done.

Still, the game gets very close to being good.  It hits on a lot of great mechanics.  It eschews regular RPG leveling and encourages interesting build designs.  It looks good, sounds good, and sometimes even plays good.  I just wish it didn't leave me constantly scratching my head.

I'm giving the game a lukewarm thumbs up.  I hope the developers continue to innovate on the Monster Hunter formula, and spend a little more time polishing up those rough edges.
